# Weather Data Analysis 

```{r Load library}
library(tidyverse)
```
Some important comments:

 - Command + option + I : make a new chunk of code
 - <- : same as equal sign
 - Option + - : makes the arrow key that assigns a variable
 - ../ : moves the current directory to the previous folder, useful for finding files in  other folders
 - ? function : you figure out what the function means and how to run it, what arguments it takes, etc.
 - head() : first 6 rows of data frame
 - colnames() : names of columns of data frame


```{r Read in data}
sf_weather <- read.csv("../raw_data/sf_weather_2023.csv")

head(sf_weather)
colnames(sf_weather)

```
Rule of thumb: if you're bringing something outside of R, you should probably use quotes. If it's within R, you might not need quotes

Some important comments:

 - select(variable, column name) : to select a certain column
 - %>% : pipe, looks at the top folder (before %>%) and keeps going down
 - Command + shift + m : makes %>%


```{r Subset the data}
#both of these codes are the same, one doesn't use nest and the other does
select(sf_weather, DATE)

date <- sf_weather %>%
  select(DATE)

head(date)
```
Some important comments:

 - c(x, y, z) : makes a list of what you want
 - summary(variable) : gives a summary of your data frame
 - na.omit() : removes NA data
 - separate(column, c("names of new columns"), sep = "character you want to separate with", remove = FALSE) : takes one column and splits it into as many columns as you need
   - remove = FALSE stops the deletion of the initial column
 - == : not saying that YEAR is 2023, but asking you to compare whether year equals 2023
 - mutate(new_column = formula) : makes a new column
 - group_by(column) : grouping data by values in a column
 - summarize(column = formula) : creates a new data frame with the given column and 


```{r Subset and split out data}
sf_weather_temp <- sf_weather %>%
  select(c(DATE, TMAX, TMIN)) %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  separate(DATE, c("YEAR", "MONTH", "DAY"), sep = "-", remove = FALSE) %>%
  filter(YEAR == "2021") %>%
  mutate(TAVG = ((TMAX+TMIN) / 2) ) %>%
  group_by(MONTH) %>%
  summarize(MAX_MO_TEMP = max(TAVG))
  

summary(sf_weather_temp)
head(sf_weather_temp)
```
```{r Plotting our data}
plot(sf_weather_temp)
```


Making this a function for all years:
```{r Apply functions}
yearly_subsetter <- function(year){
  year_subset <- sf_weather %>%
    select(c(DATE, TMAX, TMIN)) %>%
    na.omit() %>%
    separate(DATE, c("YEAR", "MONTH", "DAY"), sep = "-", remove = FALSE) %>%
    filter(YEAR == year) %>%
    mutate(TAVG = ((TMAX+TMIN) / 2) ) %>%
    group_by(MONTH) %>%
    summarize(MAX_MO_TEMP = max(TAVG))
  
  return(year_subset)
}

yearly_subsetter("2020")
```

```{r Apply function to data}
year_var <- "1980"

plot(yearly_subsetter(year = year_var),  main = year_var)
```
Important commands:
 - for(new variable = c(specific rows)) {whatever you want to do to it} : this generates a for loop


Making for loops:
```{r Applying function with loops, fig.height=6, fig.width=4}
for(my_year_var in c("1970", "1980", "1990", "2000")){
  plot(yearly_subsetter(year = my_year_var), main = my_year_var)
}
```
